# Taly Language
This is a transpiler for Taly, a simple but really powerful language that compiles to C, which means all your favorites library will probably be available.

## Motivations
Here are the main goals of Taly:
- Easy to read
- Easy & fast to create applications
- Easy to use libraries
- Compatible with C
- Safe

## Important things to know
There is no garbage collector in Taly, however it is still safe and frees the memory for you, this is thanks to the compiler checking the lifetime of each variable to know where it is not used anymore.
A second important thing is that like Java, everything is a reference and it is not cloned by default.

Hope you like and adopt the language, btw this is Taly üêøÔ∏è!
